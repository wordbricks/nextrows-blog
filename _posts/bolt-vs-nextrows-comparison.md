The no-code world is full of tools promising to simplify work, but each serves a different purpose. **Bolt** and **NextRows** are two such tools, both designed for non-engineers, both simple to use, but they target very different problems. Let's explore the differences, use cases, and how they can complement your workflow.

## What They Do

**Bolt** is an **AI-powered builder** for websites, web apps, and **mobile apps**. With simple command messages, you can quickly generate full-featured apps and websites without coding. If you're building a mobile app, Bolt is the go-to platform. Its focus is on design, functionality, and app deployment.

**NextRows**, on the other hand, is built for **data extraction, processing, and workflow automation**. Using plain-language commands, it can scrape data from websites, clean it into structured tables, and automate recurring tasks—all without writing scripts.

## Who They're For

Both tools are tailored for non-engineers who want results without coding:

- **Bolt**: Entrepreneurs, product builders, and creators who want to launch websites, web apps, or mobile apps quickly
- **NextRows**: Business support teams, analysts, researchers, and anyone handling repetitive data tasks

## UX and No-Code Philosophy

Both Bolt and NextRows offer **simple, command-driven UX**, letting you focus on your goals rather than the technical implementation. The difference lies in the type of "heavy lifting" they handle:

- **Bolt** handles app and website creation, including mobile apps
- **NextRows** handles web data extraction, processing, and workflow automation

## Real-World Example

- **Bolt**:  
> "Create a mobile app for my new service with a homepage, signup flow, and dashboard."

- **NextRows**:  
> "Scrape newly updated product catalogues from competitor sites including the ratings and reviews in the last 7 days, clean the table, and update my Google Sheet."

Bolt lets you launch apps and websites quickly, while NextRows automates time-consuming data tasks, helping you stay on top of competitor changes and market trends.

## Synergy: Using Both Together

These tools can complement each other:

- Use **NextRows** to gather insights from competitor websites, product ratings, and recent reviews
- Use those insights to design better websites, web apps, or mobile apps with **Bolt**
- Track analytics from your apps or sites using **NextRows** to automate reporting and workflow

By combining them, you turn raw data into actionable insights and polished digital products—no coding required.
