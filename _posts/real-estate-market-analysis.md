## The Real Estate Data Challenge

Real estate professionals need to track:
- New listings across multiple platforms
- Price changes in specific neighborhoods
- Days on market trends
- Comparable sales data
- Rental yield calculations

Doing this manually across Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, and local MLS sites is virtually impossible at scale.
