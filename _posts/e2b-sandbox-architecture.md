At NextRows, we are building AI agents that can perform complex software tasks on your behalf—from interacting with web applications to writing and executing code. But giving an AI that level of autonomy raises a critical question: how do you let it run code, install packages, and interact with live systems without risking security or stability?

This is a challenge we've taken very seriously. The answer for us lies in a technology called [E2B](https://e2b.dev) Sandboxes. This post explains what sandboxes are, why they are essential for a service like NextRows, and what it all means for your experience as a user.

## What is a Sandbox?

Imagine a real sandbox where a child plays. They can build sandcastles, dig holes, and make a mess, but all the sand stays contained within the box. Nothing they do affects the clean lawn outside.

In the world of software, a sandbox is the exact same concept. It's a secure, isolated environment where we can run code without it affecting our main application, our servers, or other users' data. It's a firewalled, virtual playground where code can execute freely without any risk to the outside world.

## E2B in Action: Powering Our AI Agents

At the heart of our application is an intelligent AI agent that acts as an orchestrator, figuring out how to complete complex tasks for you. To do its job, this agent is equipped with a set of powerful tools, much like a developer has a command line.

When the agent needs to perform a hands-on task—like running a shell command, applying a code patch, or interacting with a file system—it uses its specialized tools. This is where [E2B](https://e2b.dev) becomes critical. Instead of executing these operations on our core infrastructure (which would be a major security risk), the agent delegates the task to a secure E2B sandbox.

Our Next.js backend sends the command to a fresh, ephemeral [E2B](https://e2b.dev) runtime. The sandbox executes the command in its isolated environment, captures the output, and reports the results back to our agent. Once the job is done, the sandbox and everything in it vanishes. This architecture gives our AI the power of a full-stack developer environment without compromising security.

## What This Means for Your User Experience

Adopting E2B sandboxes isn't just a technical decision; it's a commitment to providing a better, safer, and more powerful user experience. Here's how it directly benefits you:

### 1. Uncompromising Security and Trust

This is the most critical benefit. By isolating all code execution, we ensure that nothing can accidentally (or maliciously) impact our core systems or your data. You can use our most advanced features with full confidence, knowing your information is safe and our platform is secure.

### 2. Unlocking Powerful New Features

Many of the most exciting features in modern software, like allowing an AI agent to build and run a script to solve a problem, come with inherent risks. Sandboxes remove that risk, allowing us to innovate freely. We can offer you incredibly powerful tools that would otherwise be too dangerous to implement, giving you a more capable and intelligent product.

### 3. Reliability and Consistency

Have you ever heard a developer say, "Well, it works on my machine"? Sandboxes eliminate that problem. Every piece of code runs in a standardized, clean environment, which means features work consistently and reliably every single time. The result is a smoother, more predictable experience with fewer bugs.

## Our Key Takeaways

Integrating E2B sandboxes into our architecture allows us to:

**Innovate Safely:** We can build cutting-edge, AI-driven features without compromising on security.

**Protect Our Users:** Your data and privacy are paramount, and sandboxing is a cornerstone of our security strategy.

**Deliver a Stable Product:** We provide a more reliable and consistent experience by ensuring code runs in a controlled environment.

Ultimately, E2B sandboxes are an invisible but essential part of delivering a powerful and trustworthy service.
