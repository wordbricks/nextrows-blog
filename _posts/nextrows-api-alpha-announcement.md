From the very beginning of our journey with NextRows, the feedback from our community has been the driving force behind our innovation. Over the past few months, a clear and consistent message has emerged from countless conversations with fellow engineers and developers: "We love the data extraction capabilities, but can we get them programmatically?"

You asked, and we listened.

Today, we are incredibly excited to announce that we've added another pillar to our service. Please welcome the NextRows API!

## A New Way to Access Data Extraction

We understand that for developers, the command line, a Python script, or a JavaScript application is home. You need to integrate data extraction seamlessly into your workflows, applications, and services. The NextRows API is built precisely for that—to give you the power of our intelligent data extraction engine, accessible with a simple, clean, and RESTful API.

## This is Just the Beginning (Alpha Release)

We're launching the NextRows API today in an alpha version. What does that mean? It means it's ready for you to use, to build with, and to test. It also means it's not perfect... yet.

Our philosophy is to build in public and evolve with our users. We wanted to get this powerful tool into your hands as quickly as possible. Now, we need your help to make it better every single day. We invite you to try it out, push its limits, and share your feedback. Your insights will be invaluable as we move towards a stable, feature-rich V1 release.

## Getting Started in Seconds

We've made it as simple as possible to get up and running. Here's how you can make your first request in just a few steps.

### 1. Get Your API Key

First things first, you'll need an API key.

**Generate your key here:** <a href="https://nextrows.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">https://nextrows.com/dashboard</a>

Navigate to the API Keys section and create your key. It will start with `sk-nr-`.

### 2. Make Your First Request

Use this simple example to extract data from any webpage. Just replace `sk-nr-your-api-key` with the key you just generated.

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nextrows.com/v1/extract \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-nr-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "url",
    "data": ["https://example.com/products"],
    "prompt": "Extract product names, prices, and descriptions"
  }'
```

**Python**

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.nextrows.com/v1/extract"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk-nr-your-api-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "type": "url",
    "data": ["https://example.com/products"],
    "prompt": "Extract product names, prices, and descriptions"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

**JavaScript (Node.js)**

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.nextrows.com/v1/extract', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk-nr-your-api-key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'url',
    data: ['https://example.com/products'],
    prompt: 'Extract product names, prices, and descriptions'
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

### 3. Understand the Response

NextRows returns clean, structured data in JSON format, ready for you to use.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "product_name": "Wireless Headphones",
      "price": "$99.99",
      "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation"
    },
    {
      "product_name": "Smart Watch",
      "price": "$299.99",
      "description": "Feature-rich smartwatch with health tracking"
    }
  ]
}
```
