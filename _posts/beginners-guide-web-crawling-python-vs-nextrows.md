In today's data-driven world, the ability to collect web data efficiently is a must-have skill for engineers, marketers, and analysts alike. Whether you're tracking competitor prices, gathering market insights, or building your own dataset, web crawling is the first step.

## Two Approaches to Web Data Extraction

In this guide, we'll walk through **two ways to crawl web data**:

### **Option 1: Writing [Python](https://www.python.org) Code**
Using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for full control

### **Option 2: Using [NextRows](https://nextrows.com)**
A no-code tool that makes data crawling as easy as copy-paste

---

## Method 1: Crawling with Python

If you're comfortable writing code, [Python](https://www.python.org) gives you full control over how you collect and structure your data. Below is a step-by-step example you can follow as a beginner.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

**What each library does:**

• **`requests`** – Sends HTTP requests to websites  
• **`beautifulsoup4`** – Parses HTML so you can extract the data you want  
• **`pandas`** – Helps store and manipulate data in a structured table

### Step 2: Fetch the Webpage

```python
import requests

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.status_code)  # 200 means success
print(response.text[:500])   # show a snippet of the HTML
```

### Step 3: Parse HTML with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# Example: grab all the links
links = soup.find_all("a")

for link in links[:10]:
    print(link.get("href"))
```

### Step 4: Extract Specific Data

Let's say we want to extract product information:

```python
products = soup.find_all("div", class_="product-item")

data = []
for product in products:
    title = product.find("h2").get_text(strip=True)
    price = product.find("span", class_="price").get_text(strip=True)
    data.append({"title": title, "price": price})
```

### Step 5: Save Data to CSV

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv("products.csv", index=False)

print("Data saved to products.csv")
```

✅ **Success!** You now have a dataset ready for analysis.

### Common Challenges with DIY Crawlers

• ❌ **Technical barrier** – Requires programming knowledge  
• ❌ **Fragile code** – Pages often change HTML structure, breaking your scraper  
• ❌ **Complex scenarios** – Handling pagination, JavaScript-heavy sites, or CAPTCHAs gets tricky  
• ❌ **Rate limiting** – Risk of getting blocked without proper throttling  
• ❌ **Maintenance burden** – Constant updates needed as websites evolve

---

## Method 2: Crawling with NextRows

If you want to skip the technical details and get straight to usable data, **[NextRows](https://nextrows.com)** makes the process much easier.

### How It Works

Instead of writing 50+ lines of code, you simply:

1. **Copy & paste** the webpage link into NextRows
2. **Click to select** the data you want (titles, prices, descriptions)
3. **Export instantly** to a clean table (CSV, Excel, or Google Sheets)

### What NextRows Handles Automatically

• ✅ **Pagination** – Crawls through all pages seamlessly  
• ✅ **JavaScript sites** – Works with modern dynamic websites  
• ✅ **Scheduling** – Auto-updates your data daily/weekly  
• ✅ **Data cleaning** – Removes duplicates and formats data  
• ✅ **Error handling** – Retries failed requests automatically

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** For non-engineers—or engineers who just want results faster—NextRows can save hours of development time.
