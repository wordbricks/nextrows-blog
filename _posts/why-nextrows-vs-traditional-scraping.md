## The Evolution of Web Data Extraction

Web scraping has been around since the early days of the internet, but traditional methods are showing their age. As websites become more complex and dynamic, the old ways of extracting data are becoming increasingly inefficient and unreliable.

## Traditional Web Scraping: The Challenges

### 1. High Technical Barrier
Traditional web scraping requires:
- Programming knowledge (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Understanding of HTML/CSS selectors
- Experience with debugging and error handling
- Knowledge of proxy management and rate limiting

For non-technical teams, this creates a significant bottleneck. Marketing, sales, and business analysts must rely on engineering resources for even simple data extraction tasks.

### 2. Constant Maintenance Burden
Websites change frequently:
- Layout updates break scrapers
- HTML structure modifications require code changes
- New anti-bot measures need workarounds
- API changes demand rewrites

Studies show that **60% of web scrapers break within 6 months** due to website changes, requiring constant maintenance and updates.

### 3. Time-Consuming Development
Building a robust scraper involves:
- Initial development: 2-5 days
- Testing and debugging: 1-2 days
- Deployment and monitoring setup: 1 day
- Ongoing maintenance: 2-4 hours per week

For a simple e-commerce price monitoring project, you're looking at a week of development time before seeing any results.
