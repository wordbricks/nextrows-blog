## The Data Revolution in Business

Every successful business today runs on data. From small startups to Fortune 500 companies, the ability to collect, analyze, and act on data separates winners from losers in the modern marketplace.

## Why Data-Driven Beats Gut Feeling

### The Cost of Intuition-Based Decisions

Traditional decision-making relies on:
- Past experiences that may no longer apply

Studies show that **67% of business decisions based purely on intuition fail** to achieve their intended outcomes.

### The Power of Data-Driven Decisions
