Every great application needs a solid foundation, a reliable core that everything else can be built upon. For us at NextRows, that foundation is our database. We needed something powerful, developer-friendly, and ready to scale with our ambitions. After careful consideration, we chose [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

This post explains why Supabase is the perfect database and backend solution for our system and how it works together with the other tools in our stack to create the fast, real-time experience our users love.

## What is Supabase?

You might have heard Supabase described as an "open-source alternative to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)," and that's a good starting point. But it's much more than that. At its heart, Supabase is a platform that supercharges [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), one of the world's most trusted and powerful databases.

It bundles a dedicated Postgres database with a suite of essential tools like authentication, storage, and auto-generated APIs, giving developers a complete backend in a fraction of the time.

## How We Use Supabase in Our Architecture

Supabase isn't just a component in our system; it's the central source of truth for all our application data. Let's look at how it fits into our daily operations, using our system architecture as a guide.

### 1. The Primary Database & Write Path

When you perform an action in our app—like creating a new project or updating a setting—your browser sends a request to our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) backend, which is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Our backend code then takes over, using the Supabase client library (or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)) to securely write that information into our Supabase Postgres database.

This process is simple, secure, and incredibly robust. It ensures that all data mutations are handled safely through our trusted backend logic.

### 2. The Engine for Real-Time Updates

Here's where things get really interesting. We use a tool called [Zero](https://zerosync.dev) to power the "live" features of our service. For Zero to work, it needs to know instantly when any data changes. This is where the synergy between Supabase and Zero shines.

Supabase exposes the native logical replication stream from Postgres. Think of this as a live feed of every single change happening in the database. Our real-time system connects directly to this stream.

So, when our Next.js backend writes a change to Supabase, that change is immediately picked up by Zero's replication manager. Zero then processes the change and pushes it out to all connected users in milliseconds. This is how your screen updates instantly without needing a refresh.

## The Supabase Advantage: More Than Just a Database

Supabase isn't just a hosted Postgres database; it's a complete Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). This integrated approach is its core advantage. Right out of the box, we get:

**Instant APIs:** Supabase automatically generates a secure and performant RESTful API based on our database schema. This single feature saved us weeks of backend development time.

**Built-in Authentication:** A complete user management system with email, password, and social logins is ready to go, letting us implement secure access control from day one.

**File Storage:** Simple and scalable storage for user-generated content like images and documents.

**Real-time Subscriptions:** It has a built-in engine that can broadcast database changes over websockets. This core capability is what makes our advanced real-time architecture possible.

## The Core Technology: Why It Matters for Startups

The magic of Supabase is that it isn't reinventing the wheel. It intelligently combines powerful, best-in-class open-source projects like PostgreSQL (the database) and PostgREST (the API layer). For a startup, this is a game-changer:

**Incredible Speed:** We can build and launch features faster. Instead of spending months on backend infrastructure, we focus on what makes our product unique.

**Enterprise Power, Startup Cost:** We get the reliability and power of Postgres that billion-dollar companies rely on, but with a pricing model that works for a small team.

**No Vendor Lock-in:** Because Supabase is open-source, we always have an exit strategy. If we ever need to, we can take our data and self-host the entire stack. This gives us immense freedom and security for the future.

## Our Commitment to a Reliable Infrastructure

Delivering a seamless, real-time experience requires an infrastructure that is both powerful and reliable. We've built our system on a modern, scalable cloud environment designed for high availability.

Our real-time services run as managed, containerized tasks, which allows our system to scale efficiently based on user demand. This ensures that the application remains fast and responsive, no matter how many users are active. At the heart of it all, our Supabase database serves as the stable, central hub for all our data.

To protect our data and ensure business continuity, we have automated, continuous backups in place. This robust setup means we can focus on building great features, confident that the underlying infrastructure is resilient, secure, and ready to grow with our user base.

## Our Key Takeaways

Choosing Supabase has given us a number of key advantages:

**The Power of Postgres, Simplified:** We get the full power of a true relational database without the typical headaches of database management.

**Seamless Integration:** Supabase integrates perfectly with our stack. Its replication stream is the key that unlocks our real-time architecture with Zero.

**Incredible Developer Experience:** The client libraries are a joy to work with, making backend development faster and more intuitive.

**Focus on Innovation:** By simplifying our backend, Supabase frees up our team to work on features that truly matter to our users, like our E2B sandboxes and advanced LLM integrations.
