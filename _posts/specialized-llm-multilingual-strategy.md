At the heart of NextRows is a powerful AI agent designed to understand your goals and execute complex tasks. With a growing user base from over 100 countries, we're passionate about making our service accessible and intuitive for everyone, no matter what language they speak.

This intelligence is driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), but we quickly realized that to deliver an exceptional global experience, we needed a specialized tool for the job. To provide best-in-class support for our Korean-speaking users, we chose to partner with Upstage and integrate their groundbreaking Solar LLM.

## The Challenge with General-Purpose LLMs

Large, general-purpose models are incredible, but they often come with trade-offs. We faced a few key challenges:

**Speed:** Many of the largest models can have noticeable latency, which slows down the user experience.

**Cost:** The operational costs of running state-of-the-art models at scale can be significant.

**Specificity:** General models aren't specialists. We needed a model that could be fine-tuned to excel at the specific tasks our users perform.

**The Language Barrier:** As a team from diverse backgrounds, we've personally felt the friction of services available only in English. We knew that providing a truly global service meant supporting our users in their native languages, but many models have a heavy English bias, making high-quality multilingual support a major hurdle.

## Why Upstage Solar for Korean Language Support?

Upstage has made waves in the AI community by proving that smaller, purpose-built models can outperform much larger ones. Their Solar LLM was the perfect solution for our Korean language needs.

Here's what makes Upstage Solar stand out:

**World-Class Performance:** The Solar model consistently ranks among the top-performing open models in global benchmarks, delivering incredible accuracy.

**Unmatched Speed and Efficiency:** Because it's a more compact model, Solar provides responses with lower latency. This translates to a snappier, more responsive experience.

**Fine-Tuning Expertise:** Upstage provides powerful tools for fine-tuning the Solar model on our own data, allowing us to create a specialized version of the LLM.

**Exceptional Multilingual Capabilities:** While many models claim multilingual support, Upstage has demonstrated exceptional performance, particularly in Korean. This gave us a clear path to begin breaking down language barriers.

## How We Use Upstage in Our Architecture

In our system, the Next.js-based orchestrating agent acts as the central "brain." When a task is identified as being in Korean, this agent makes a direct API call to our fine-tuned Upstage Solar model. The model's response then guides the agent's next steps, ensuring a high-quality, localized experience. For other languages, the agent routes the request to a general-purpose model.

## The Benefits for Our Users

Choosing Upstage directly translates into a better product for you.

**Speaking Your Language:** Our global community is our priority. As a first step in our multilingual journey, we leveraged Upstage Solar to provide native support for the Korean language. The results were immediate and clear: satisfaction scores among our Korean-speaking users increased by 20%. This is just the beginning of our commitment to making NextRows feel like a local tool for everyone.

**A Faster Experience for Korean Users:** With Upstage's low latency, our AI agent feels more responsive for our Korean-speaking users. They get the answers and results they need faster, making the entire experience feel more fluid and natural.

**More Accurate Results in Korean:** By fine-tuning the Solar model, we've created an AI that is an expert in its domain. It understands the nuances of requests in Korean better and provides more helpful solutions.

**A Blueprint for Future Languages:** The efficiency and success of our Upstage integration for Korean provide a powerful blueprint for us to support more languages in the future, allowing us to innovate faster.

## Conclusion

Our partnership with Upstage allows us to leverage a world-class, specialized LLM to serve our global community, starting with our Korean-speaking users. It's a key part of our strategy to build the most intelligent, responsive, and reliable AI agent possible for a global audience.
