## The Research Data Challenge

Academic researchers spend countless hours:
- Searching through multiple academic databases
- Tracking new publications in their field
- Monitoring citations of their work
- Collecting data from various sources
- Keeping up with preprints and conference papers
- Managing systematic literature reviews

Manual data collection limits research scope and delays discoveries.

## NextRows for Academic Research

### Comprehensive Literature Monitoring

Automatically track publications from:
- **Academic databases**: PubMed, IEEE, ArXiv, JSTOR
- **Publisher sites**: Elsevier, Springer, Wiley
- **Preprint servers**: bioRxiv, SSRN, RePEc

- **Conference proceedings**: ACM, NeurIPS, ICML
- **Google Scholar**: Citations and related work

### Research Data Collection

Gather data efficiently from:
- Government statistics portals
- Clinical trial databases
- Patent databases
- Survey platforms
- Social media for sentiment studies
- News archives for media analysis
